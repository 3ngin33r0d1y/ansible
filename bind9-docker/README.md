# You want a real DNS Server at home? (bind9 + docker)
WIP

Video: // WIP

---
## Prerequisites

Before you can deploy Bind9 in Docker, you need a Linux Server that has **Docker**, and **Docker-Compose** installed.

For further References, how to use **Docker**, and **Docker-Compose**, check out my previous videos:
- [How to use Docker and migrate your existing Apps to your Linux Server?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0GGQ2F2tvs)
- [Docker-Compose Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4ZKfwbO8w)

*You can still install Bind9 on a Linux Server that is not running Docker, however, this may require different commands!*
